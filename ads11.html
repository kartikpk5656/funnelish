    <h1>Top tips on building and maintaining healthy relationships</h1>
    <p>Building and maintaining healthy relationships is an important part of looking after our mental health. Here are 6 top tips to support you with yours.

1. Get to know yourself
Take the time to appreciate yourself and get in touch with your emotions to be able to express yourself clearly and more effectively. 

Not knowing how to regulate your emotions and express them healthily can negatively affect your mental wellbeing.

2. Put in the work 
Healthy relationships are not found but built.

A healthy relationship needs commitment and willingness to be accommodating to each other’s needs.

Healthy Relationships - Top Tips
3. Set and respect boundaries
Setting boundaries is not only about what you don’t want or like in your relationships, but also about letting the people around you know what you appreciate. 

Think about and let others know where your boundaries are; respecting your time alone for example.

Doing this can take the pressure off your relationship to commit to anything unrealistic.

4. Talk and Listen 
All relationships have disagreements and that’s ok. what matters is how you talk and listen to one another.

Listen to understand, rather than listening to respond.

Don’t be afraid to express your emotions or vulnerabilities with people you trust.

5. Let go of control
A lot of life is about how we react to our experiences and encounters. Knowing that you can only really control what you do and not what anyone else does will save you time and stress. 

6. Reflect and learn
If you have a healthy way of expressing your feelings, you’re able to react to other people’s in a healthy way. Being angry with someone often comes from a place of feeling hurt and upset. if you can recognise that, you can communicate it, and build better relationships with others.</p>
